Create a program with a float list generator and other features
Create a program that allows the user to work with lists of float numbers.
The program will offer the user the following options:
1) Fill randomly a list where the user selects the number of elements and the upper and lower bound.
2) Fill randomly a list where the number of elements and the upper and lower bound are in the range [1,1000).
3) Manually enter a list: the user will select the number of elements and he/she will enter their values.
4) Shrink the list: the program will create a new list with half the size of the original list and that will
be the result of adding the elements of the original list by pairs (the first element of the resulting list will
be the result of adding the first and second elements of the original list, the second element will be the sum
of the third and the fourth, and so on). Consider the case where the original list has an odd number of elements.
5) Invert the list (without using the reverse method): once the list has been introduced, the program will
return a list where the elements are placed in reverse order (the first will be the last and so on)
6) Print a list: the program will print the list, truncating the numbers to their integer values."""
