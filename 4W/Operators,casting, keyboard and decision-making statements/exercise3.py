"""
In this exercise three main variables are declared, a,b,c. The variables
(r,s,t,u,v,w,x) are declared directly with a condition based in a relational operator. 
Because relational operators always give as result a bool, the variables (r,s,t,u,v,w,x)
will have a bool value based on the solution of the relation. 
Example: a is not equal to 0, so a == 0 is false and the variables r, defined as the 
relation of a == 0 is also false.
